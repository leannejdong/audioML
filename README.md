Simply `pip install -r requirements.txt` to recreate the python virtual environment.

We want to generate synthetic audio data for the purpose of training specific effects.

Generating synthetic audio data for training specific effects involves using algorithms or models to simulate the desired audio characteristics. Here are a few examples of how we could generate synthetic audio data for training different effects:

1. Reverb:

Impulse response simulation: Simulate the acoustic characteristics of different spaces by generating synthetic impulse responses. One can use algorithms like geometric acoustics or ray tracing to model the sound propagation and reflections within a virtual environment.
Synthetic room modeling: Create artificial room impulse responses by simulating the behavior of sound in enclosed spaces. This can involve modeling wall reflections, air absorption, and diffusion to generate realistic synthetic reverb.

2. Distortion/Overdrive:

Waveform shaping: Use mathematical functions, such as waveshaping algorithms, to manipulate clean audio signals and introduce distortion. One can experiment with different shaping functions like soft clipping, hard clipping, or sigmoid functions to achieve varying degrees of distortion.
Circuit modeling: Simulate the behavior of analog circuits, such as guitar pedals or tube amplifiers, by modeling their nonlinear characteristics. Circuit modeling techniques like digital waveguide models or convolution-based approaches can be used to generate distorted audio signals.

3. Chorus/Flanger/Phaser:

Modulation algorithms: Use modulation algorithms like delay lines, all-pass filters, and LFOs (low-frequency oscillators) to create the desired modulation effects. Varying the modulation rate, depth, and feedback parameters can generate different chorusing, flanging, or phasing sounds.


4. Equalizer:

Filter design: Use digital filter design techniques to create filters with specific frequency responses. One can design filters based on desired characteristics such as low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, or notch filters, and apply them to audio signals to simulate equalization.
When generating synthetic audio data, it's important to consider the specific characteristics and nuances of the effect we are aiming to emulate. Experimentation and fine-tuning of parameters are often necessary to achieve desired results. Additionally, combining synthetic data with real-world recordings can help create more diverse and realistic training datasets.
